Introduces formal logic and its connections to Computer Science. Students learn to translate statements about 
the behavior of computer programs into logical claims and to prove such assertions using both traditional techniques 
and automated tools. Considers approaches to proving termination, correctness, and safety for programs. Discusses propositional 
and predicate logic, logical inference, recursion and recursively defined sets, mathematical induction, and structural induction.
