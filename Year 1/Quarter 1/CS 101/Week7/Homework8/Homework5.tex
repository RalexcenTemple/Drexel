function VirtualPest(): virtualpest function will create the values
Hunger, Love, feedTime, petTime, exciteTime, State,

to the Done.png, sets the feedTime, petTime, and exciteTime to zero

function Display(): displays the state, has the pet action to standing,
sets the pet sound to “yo, meow”

function Simulate(): checks the amount of time difference there is
between the different time variables and the current time and changes
the state, sound, action, and display of the pest accordingly

function Pet(): adjusts the petTime to the current time, and based
on the love variable, may cause the exciteTime to be set to current
time. And then changes the display and state, as well as any other
variables accordingly based on the affects of pet.
