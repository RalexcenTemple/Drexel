Part 1: Interfaces:
1.1: describe what is meant by each of the following
i:Hide implementation details:
	This  means that parts of the interface that are most likely to change
later on should be hiden from the rest to reduce development risk so that if
they need to be changed later on, the code and itself are not entirely
dependent on one another to work the way they were intialy created to work.

ii:Choose small orthogonal set of primitives:
	This implies that the interface should use variable types and functions
that provide as much functionality as possible that will not overlap the
capabilities of the other functions. these functions or constructs are then
able to be applied in different combinations to accomplish the tasked
needed.

iii:Don't reach behind the users back:
	This means that the interface should not create data or change data
without the users knowledge or consent.

iv:Do the same thing the same way everywhere:
	This is meant to tell the programmer that they should use the same style
and structure in all of their programming as well as the way the programming
is used. so if the order that information is sent in one function is int
string bool, then you should probably keep that same order of variables for
other functions. 

1.2:What are the problems w/the first implementation in C
pretty sure that because buf is set to a preditermined size it means that it
can only take so many characters or strings at a time.
